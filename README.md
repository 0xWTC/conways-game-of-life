## Requirements

* Python 3
* PyGame

## How it works

The game is a simple cellular automaton. The rules are:

* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## How to run it

in the terminal run
`python life.py`
